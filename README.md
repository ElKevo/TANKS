# TANKS
Extended Multiplayer Version of the Unity Tanks Tutorial

Hey! I somehow got the idea of "pimping" the TANKS! Game from the Unity Asset store (free: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/46209) since i think it would be a pretty nice party game. 
What i would like to do now, is to find someone who is willing to collaborate and give something to the unity community. So, i can provide graphics but i need a dev who helps me with the implementation of the UI. and after that its done, we gonna put it on github and see what other people will do with it. 

what do you think?

here are is a screenshot of the Main UI
